```html
<!-- Solution using flexbox -->
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 flex justify-end">
  <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
    Button
  </button>
</div>
```

This solution uses flexbox's `justify-end` to align the button to the right within its container, providing a reliable and cleaner approach compared to relying on floating elements.
